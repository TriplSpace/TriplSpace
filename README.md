- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @TriplSpace (Celia Coates)
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in video games, art, and nature.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m a senior studying computer science. My two favorite classes right now are Programming Challenges and Exotic Computing.
- I'm currently thinking about making a game that uses procedural generation with cellular automata in a new way, creating a variety of 'biomes' or 'regions' that use different rules for generation.
