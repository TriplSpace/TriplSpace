- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @TriplSpace (Tommy Coates)
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in video games, art, and nature.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning R and VHDL while abroad in Ireland!
- I'm currently thinking about making a game that uses procedural generation with cellular automata in a new way, creating a variety of 'biomes' or 'regions'
  that use different rules for generation.
