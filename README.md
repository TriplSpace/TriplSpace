- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @TriplSpace (Celia Coates)
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in video games, art, and nature.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m a junior studying computer science. My two favorite classes right now are Intro to Quantum Computing and VFX.
- I'm currently thinking about making a game that uses procedural generation with cellular automata in a new way, creating a variety of 'biomes' or 'regions' that use different rules for generation.
